[Deployed Google Books App!](https://google-books-hw21.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

This application lets the user search for books in the google database and save them to a book list where they can view them later or delete them from the list.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to create a reading list that I can view and update.

## Usage

When the user navigates to this page, they can search for a book by title or author.

After searching, they will see the top 10 search results.  Every result will give them a chance to "view" which will take them to the google books page with more information about that specific book, or "save" which will save the book to their saved page for later viewing.

When viewing the saved list the user can again "View" a book, or "Delete" the book which removed it from their viewing list.
